### Multi-Agent AI Systems for Financial Portfolio Management and Option Pricing

**Serge Youmbi** | *2025*

In advanced multi-agent frameworks, the deployment of domain-specific LLM-powered agents—each fulfilling unique functions such as fundamental analysis, sentiment interpretation, technical assessment, and trading with tailored risk profiles—creates a robust ecosystem for financial strategy formulation. Through systematic deliberation and cooperative decision-making, these agents collectively enhance trading efficacy, yielding marked improvements in cumulative returns, risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe ratio), and drawdown resilience relative to conventional benchmark approaches.

### Algebraic Effects and Delimited Continuations for Multi-Agent AI Systems in Financial Portfolio Management and Options Pricing

**Serge Youmbi** | *2025*

This document presents an architectural framework for building multi-agent AI systems in the financial domain using Kyo's algebraic effect system. Kyo, developed by Flavio Brasil at Nubank, introduces a novel approach to effect handling through first-class delimited continuations that can be resumed zero, one, or multiple times.

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on callback chains, promise combinators, or actor-based message passing, Kyo's continuation-based semantics enable sophisticated control flow patterns essential for financial applications: speculative execution for latency-sensitive pricing, transactional rollback for failed multi-leg trades, fan-out aggregation for consensus pricing, and checkpoint/resume for long-running optimisation loops.

- Production-ready architecture for institutional finance

### Multi-LLM Orchestration Patterns for Supply Chain Systems

**Serge Youmbi** | *2025*

Modern supply chains operate across vast, interconnected networks that demand intelligent coordination of logistics, inventory, and distribution. Building on foundational principles from operations research—such as Simchi-Levi's "Operations Rules" for balancing efficiency and resilience—this work explores how multi-LLM orchestration can extend these frameworks.

By dynamically selecting and coordinating large language models based on task complexity, urgency, and precision, it introduces a principled architecture for applying advanced AI to supply chain optimisation.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Conceptualising Trigraphs: A Generalisation of Milner's Bigraphs

**Serge Youmbi** | *Working Paper*

We explore a conceptual generalisation of Robin Milner's Bigraphs, known for forming a symmetric partial monoidal category, into a novel concept termed "Trigraphs." We discuss the foundational aspects of Bigraphs, propose potential interpretations for a third structural component in Trigraphs, and consider how the categorical operations might be extended.
