## Hello, I'm Serge Youmbi

I am a **PhD Researcher** at the **University of Derby**, where I explore the fascinating intersection of **Category Theory**, **Deep Learning**, and **Computational Finance**. My research aims to bring mathematical rigour to AI systems while ensuring they remain practical and deployable in real-world financial environments.

## Research Philosophy

> *"The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise."*
> — Edsger W. Dijkstra

I believe that the most powerful AI systems are built on solid mathematical foundations. Category theory provides the perfect lens for understanding the compositional nature of neural networks, while algebraic effects offer a principled approach to managing the complexity inherent in financial systems.

## Academic Background

### Current Position
**PhD Candidate in Computer Science**
University of Derby, United Kingdom
*Research Focus: Category-Theoretic Approaches to Deep Learning with Applications in Finance*

### Research Interests

- **Category Theory & Machine Learning** — Using functors, natural transformations, and monads to design compositional neural architectures
- **Multi-Agent AI Systems** — Orchestrating specialised LLM agents for complex financial decision-making
- **Algebraic Effects** — Type-safe effect handling for financial applications using delimited continuations
- **Formal Methods in Finance** — Ensuring correctness and compliance through mathematical proofs
- **Quantitative Trading** — Neural differential equations and reinforcement learning for portfolio optimisation

## Beyond Research

When I'm not diving into mathematical abstractions or training neural networks, I enjoy:

- **Teaching** — Sharing knowledge through tutorials and workshops
- **Open Source** — Contributing to functional programming and ML communities
- **Writing** — Making complex topics accessible through blog posts and documentation
- **Mentoring** — Helping young people (in particular secondary school pupils) sharpen their curiosity about Mathematics and languages (natural languages and programming languages)
